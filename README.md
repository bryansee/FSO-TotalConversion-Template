# FreeSpace Open Total Conversion Template

The template for FSO total conversions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Knossos](https://github.com/ngld/knossos)
2.  A very recent FS2 Open Nightly Build

### Installation

1.  Create a TC mod on Knossos, and create a required package, with FSO being the required one. You can skip this if you want.
2.  Extract the contents on the newly created package's folder, or a new folder where the FSO Nightly Build is extracted to.
3.  Modify the ships.tbl and weapons.tbl files by adding at least one entry. Be sure to specify the default player ship in the ships.tbl.
4.  Add the relevant assets (models, maps, effects, HUD, interface, etc.) into the folders.
